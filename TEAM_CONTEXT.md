## 🚨 IMPORTANT GUIDELINES

### Security First
- **NEVER commit secrets** to version control
- **Always validate input** from external sources
- **Use parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection
- **Implement rate limiting** on all public endpoints
- **Follow principle of least privilege** for access controls

### Performance Considerations
- **Optimize database queries** - use indexes and avoid N+1 queries
- **Implement caching** where appropriate (Redis)
- **Monitor response times** - aim for <100ms API responses
- **Use connection pooling** for database connections
- **Implement graceful degradation** for external service failures

### Code Quality
- **Write tests first** (TDD approach preferred)
- **Keep functions small** (<50 lines typically)
- **Use meaningful variable names** and comments
- **Handle errors gracefully** with proper logging
- **Document complex business logic** thoroughly

## 🆘 GETTING HELP

### When You're Stuck
1. **Check Documentation** - Most answers are in the docs
2. **Search GitHub Issues** - Someone might have faced the same problem
3. **Ask in Slack** - #development channel for technical questions
4. **Schedule 1:1** - With team lead for complex architectural questions
5. **Pair Programming** - Great for learning and problem-solving

### Escalation Path
1. **Team Member** - Ask a colleague first
2. **Team Lead** - For technical decisions
3. **Architecture Team** - For system design questions
4. **Project Manager** - For timeline or priority questions

### Emergency Contacts
