## üîí SECURE DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES

### Code Security
```yaml
Static_Analysis:

  Frequency: Every commit
  Threshold: Zero high/critical issues
  
Dependency_Scanning:
  Tools: [Snyk, npm audit, OWASP Dependency Check]
  Frequency: Daily automated scans
  Action: Auto-update low-risk, manual review high-risk
  
Secret_Detection:
  Tools: [git-secrets, detect-secrets, TruffleHog]
  Pre_commit: Block commits with secrets
  Repository_Scan: Weekly full repository scan
```

### Secure Coding Guidelines
```typescript
// Input Validation Example
interface SecureInputValidation {
  sanitize: (input: string) => string;
  validate: (input: any, schema: Schema) => ValidationResult;
  escape: (html: string) => string;
  
  // SQL Injection Prevention
  query: (sql: string, params: any[]) => Promise<Result>;
  
  // XSS Prevention
  renderSafe: (content: string) => SafeHTML;
  
  // CSRF Protection
  csrfToken: () => string;
  validateCsrf: (token: string) => boolean;
}

// Secure API Design
interface SecureAPIEndpoint {
  authentication: "required";
  authorization: "role-based";
  rateLimit: "per-user + global";
  inputValidation: "strict schema";
  outputSanitization: "enabled";
  logging: "all requests + responses";
