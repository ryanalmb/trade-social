   - Mitigation: Implement intelligent rate limiting
   - Backup: Multiple API key rotation
   - Timeline Impact: Could delay Phase 2 by 1-2 weeks

2. **MEV Protection Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Start with Flashbots, expand gradually
   - Backup: Implement basic slippage protection first
   - Timeline Impact: Could delay Phase 2 by 2-3 weeks

3. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - Mitigation: Legal review at each phase
   - Backup: Implement geo-blocking if needed
   - Timeline Impact: Could delay launch by 1 month

### Medium-Risk Items
1. **Team Experience Gap**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive documentation and training
   - Backup: External consultants for critical components
   - Timeline Impact: 10-20% slower development

2. **Third-Party Service Dependencies**
   - Mitigation: Multiple provider integrations
   - Backup: Fallback mechanisms for all services
   - Timeline Impact: Minimal if planned properly
